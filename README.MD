# Simple Dictionary - Project 1
## Nicholas J Smith

This project will incorporate data from the Merriam Webster dictionary API. The site will feature a search bar where users can input any word or text. If the user input matches a word in the dictionary, the definition of the word will appear in the display.

The site will also feature a navigation bar with links to my top 5 favorite words, as well as a few of the most commonly searched words in the Merriam Webster Dictionary.

The API call will be written using jQuery.The input form as well as the results display will be built using HTML. jQuery will be used to target the user input and receive form data. The visible page elements will be styled using CSS. The navigation bar and links will be built with HTML and CSS, and the information displayed on those pages will be retrieved using jQuery.
